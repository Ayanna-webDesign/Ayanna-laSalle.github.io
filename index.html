        <p> Roses are red, <br> violets are blue</p>
        <p>I love pizza with wings<br> and so should you!</p>
<pr> The stars shine bright, <br> but not as bright as you do.</pr>
        <p> The first time i saw you <br> my heart knew</p>
        <p>Why do you laugh? <br> Am I a joke or clown to you? </p>
